Welcome to the Noc Programming Language's wiki.

## Noc versions

To get Noc, check the [Installation guide](installation.html).

#### The Noc latest version

> This version was rewritten partially (check this [section](optimizations.html) in C to embark a VM and it's not longer maintained, there are still some bugs or lack of features:
> - callstack not works with recursive functions calls
> - cannot format quotes
> - cannot operate big ints (Arbitrary precision integers)

#### The Noc v0.1.0.0

> This version is more operational but slower than the latest version because it's fully interpreted.

### Some examples

fact.noc
```scala
def fact = {
   [
     [[1] []]
     [[_] [dup 1 - dup fact *]]
   ] case
}

def main = {
   6 dup fact print
}
```

greater-or-less.noc
```scala
load std:stack
load std:bool

def readInput = {"Choose a number: " ask}

def mysteryNumber = { 45 }

def greaterOrLess = {
    dup
    [
        [[mysteryNumber] ["You won !" print]]
        [[_] [
            ["Less!" print readInput int greaterOrLess] ["Greater!" print readInput int greaterOrLess] 3 -1 rotNM mysteryNumber < if 
        ]]
    ] case
}

def main = {
    readInput int greaterOrLess
}
```

caesar.noc
```scala
load seq
load std:string
/* in the latest version the functions of the 'char' module are integrated in the Noc Prelude */
load char
load std:stack
load std:io
load sys

def caesar = {
    [
        [[[cipher]] [
                [ord swap dup 3 -1 rotNM + chr swap] step
            ]]
        [[[decipher]] [
                [ord swap dup 3 -1 rotNM swap - chr swap] step
            ]]
        [[_] ["error." putstrln 1 exit]]
    ] case

    popr pop swap quote swap <> tostr
}

def encrypt = {
    [cipher] caesar
}

def decrypt = {
    [decipher] caesar
}

def main = {
    /* [offset] [msg in array of chars] [encrypt/decrypt] */
    3 "Hello"$ encrypt print
    3 "Khoor"$ decrypt print
}
```
